## 🚀 Deploy on Railway

### One-Click Deploy

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/syncthing-2)

Click the button above to deploy Syncthing instantly on Railway.

### Prerequisites

- A [Railway](https://railway.com) account

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | No | `8384` (set by Railway) | Web UI listen port. Railway injects this automatically; the entrypoint maps it to Syncthing's GUI address. |
| `PUID` | No | `1000` | User ID for file ownership (only used when running as root) |
| `PGID` | No | `1000` | Group ID for file ownership (only used when running as root) |
| `STGUIADDRESS` | No | `0.0.0.0:${PORT}` | Override the GUI listen address (format: `<host>:<port>`) |
| `STHOMEDIR` | No | `/var/syncthing/config` | Syncthing config directory |
| `UMASK` | No | — | File creation umask (e.g., `002` for group-writable folders) |

### 🔒 Security Note

Syncthing listens on `0.0.0.0:PORT` by default so Railway's health checks and public routing work. **Set a GUI password immediately after first login** — the Web UI has no default authentication. Go to **Actions → Settings → GUI Authentication** to configure a username and password.

## 💻 Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/INAPP-Mobile/railway-syncthing.git
cd railway-syncthing

# Build and run with Docker
docker build -t syncthing-railway .
docker run -d \
  --name syncthing \
  -p 8384:8384 \
  -p 22000:22000 \
  -p 22000:22000/udp \
  -p 21027:21027/udp \
  -e PORT=8384 \
  -v syncthing-data:/var/syncthing \
  syncthing-railway

# Open the Web UI
open http://localhost:8384
```

### Using Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  syncthing:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8384:8384"
      - "22000:22000"
      - "22000:22000/udp"
      - "21027:21027/udp"
    environment:
      - PORT=8384
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
    volumes:
      - syncthing-data:/var/syncthing
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-fkLsS", "-m", "2", "http://127.0.0.1:8384/rest/noauth/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 15s

volumes:
  syncthing-data:
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Health check failing** | Ensure `PORT` env var is set correctly. Railway sets it automatically. The health check hits `/rest/noauth/health` on the Web UI port. |
| **Cannot access Web UI** | Verify the Railway domain is correct. Check logs for startup errors. The GUI listens on `0.0.0.0:PORT`. |
| **Devices can't connect** | Syncthing uses port 22000 (TCP+UDP) for sync traffic. On Railway, only the port in `PORT` is publicly routed. Other devices connect outbound from Syncthing to your devices, or via relay discovery. Configure your devices to use relay connections or ensure they can reach each other directly. |
| **Slow sync speeds** | Railway's network topology may prevent direct peer-to-peer connections. Syncthing will automatically fall back to relay connections, which are slower. For best performance, connect devices on the same LAN. |
| **Data loss on restart** | Railway provides ephemeral storage. Data persists within the service's filesystem but is not replicated. For important data, set up syncing to a secondary device as backup. |
| **Default folder not created** | Set `STFLAGS=--no-default-folder` in env vars if you want to configure folders from scratch in the Web UI. |

# Deploy and Host

## About Hosting

This template deploys **Syncthing 2.1.1** on Railway using the official Docker image. It provides a self-hosted, private file synchronization server with a browser-based management interface. The deployment maps Railway's `PORT` environment variable directly to Syncthing's web UI port, ensuring seamless platform health checks and public routing.

## Why Deploy

Self-hosting Syncthing gives you full control over your file synchronization infrastructure. Unlike cloud-based file sync services, Syncthing stores your data exclusively on your own devices — there is no central server, no third-party storage, and no data egress fees. You decide where your files live, who can access them, and how they are transmitted. This is ideal for privacy-conscious individuals, small teams, and organizations that need secure, auditable file synchronization without relying on external providers.

## Common Use Cases

- **Private Cloud Sync** — Replace Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive with a self-hosted, zero-knowledge alternative
- **Team Collaboration** — Synchronize project files across team members' devices without a central server
- **Server Backup** — Automatically sync backups from one server to another for disaster recovery
- **Media Library** — Keep media collections in sync between a home server and remote devices
- **Configuration Management** — Distribute configuration files across multiple machines

## Dependencies for Syncthing

### Deployment Dependencies

- **Railway Account** — A free Railway account with sufficient service quota
- **No External Databases** — Syncthing is self-contained with no external dependencies
- **Ephemeral Storage** — Railway provides service-level filesystem storage; no persistent volume plugin is required
